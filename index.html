    <h3>BIT2225 / BIT2225L Introduction to Game Design and Development  - (Lec: 2 units / Lab: 1 unit)</h3>
    <p>This course gives an overview of the game development process from conception to production. It also discusses a history of game development here and abroad, and exposure to the positions, job responsibilities that each member of a game development team has along with the industry requirements for the creation of a game design document (GDD) and technical design document (TDD). Game design includes gameplay, storytelling, challenges, and basic interactive design, which includes interface design, information design, and world interaction.</p>

    <h3>BIT3126 / BIT3126L Advanced Game Design - (Lec: 2 units / Lab: 1 unit)</h3>
    <p>In this course, a student will learn the interfaces of certain aspects of design. These include, but are not limited to, level design, balancing, economy, multiplayer, monetization-based design and dynamic content creation.</p>

    <h3>BIT3127 / BIT3127L Computer Graphics Programming - (Lec: 2 units / Lab: 1 unit)</h3>
    <p>In this course, students undergo an introduction to the mathematics of computer graphics as well as how they integrate to create 3D graphics programs. The learning approach of the course is to introduce computer graphics and its mathematics through a top-down approach focusing more on the applications of the mathematical concepts and limiting mathematical derivations and bottom-up learning only to some particular areas of the study. Topics included in this course are the requisite review of the needed math concepts (points, vectors, matrices), graphics transformations, rendering of primitive geometries, shading and illumination (concepts and applications), and use of OpenGL.</p>

    <h3>BIT3228 / BIT3228L Modeling and Rigging - (Lec: 2 units / Lab: 1 unit)</h3>
    <p>This course, students learn how to develop character assets in varied gradients of details based on a given concept arts. Students also learn the mechanics of rigging of models with skeleton and muscles structures which animators may move about in an actual animation production. Student will learn the theory and proper placement of critical structures based on the animation quality required and timescale. </p>

    <h3>BIT3230 Artificial Intelligence in Games</h3>
    <p>This course is about the algorithms behind Artificial Intelligence in Games. Solutions for common algorithmic problems will be discussed and analyzed. Focus will be primarily on single-play games for this course. It covers Knowledge Representation, Search Techniques (Uninformed, Informed, Adversarial), and an introduction to Machine learning techniques (Supervised and Unsupervised) as applied in games.</p>

    <h3>BIT4231 / BIT4231L Texture and Mapping (Lec: 2 units / Lab: 1 unit)</h3>
    <p>In this course, students learn how to develop texture maps and application techniques, in particular direct mapping and multi-texturing-light mapping, bump mapping. Texture filtering, aliasing reduction techniques such as bilinear interpolation and trilinear interpolation, clamping and warping covered.</p>

    <h3>BIT4232 / BIT4232L Game Networking (Lec: 2 units / Lab: 1 unit)</h3>
    <p>In this course, students will learn to create network capable games. They will also learn the underlying aspects that developers and designers need to consider when building games that uses networking technology – covers game play, security and communication.</p>
